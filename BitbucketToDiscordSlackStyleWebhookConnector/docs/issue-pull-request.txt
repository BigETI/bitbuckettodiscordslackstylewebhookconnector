Webhook pull request events ambiguous

I am working on an interface to convert webhook messages to different services. I found these problems during the development for pull request webhook events:

- Create and update events are ambiguous
- Update invokes 2 webhook requests, which are by JSON same objects (except for some date and time attributes)
- Approve, approval remove, merge and decline are ambiguous
- Comment create and delete are ambiguous
- Comment update does not invoke any webhook requests
